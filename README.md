Fortune Cookie Database
=======================

## Introduction

This repository contains a *fortune cookie database*, intended to be used
with programs like [my Python *fortune* program][],
[my Go *fortune* program][], or the [BSD *fortune* program][].
It contains more than 2,800 quotes that I've collected since about 1990 or
so.

## Files

* *fortunes* contains the actual fortunes (i.e., the quotes)
* *fortunes.dat* is an index file, suitable for use with the Python *fortune* program.
